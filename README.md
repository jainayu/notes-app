# notes-app
This is my very first node.js application for writing notes trough terminal.

## Steps to install:

**1. Clone the application using**
```gitattributes
git clone https://github.com/jainayu/notes-app
```

**2. Change the directory using**
```bash
cd notes-app
```

**3. Install the application using**
```bash
npm install
```

**4. Use `--help` to explore more about how to add, remove, read or list all the notes:
```bash
node app.js --help
```
